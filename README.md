## Code
index.html
prim.html - primitive assembly page
script1 - rotate cube using primitive assembly 
texture.html - texture mapping page
script2 - rotate cube that texture mapped
exp.html - experiece rotate, change color, move cube.


## Objects
 Primitive Assembly and Texture Mapping
 I made website that explaing about above topics. User can see what is thoes topic
 and on experience part, users can experience transport, changing color, rotate cube.

## Function

## First Page
User can Choose 3 categories, 1.Primitive Assembly, 2.Texture Mapping 3.Experience
If choose one categories, Users enter specific page of choosen topic,

## 1.Primitive Assembly
Users will understand what is Primitive Assembly, and can rotate of cube that made by gl.TRIANGES

## 2.Texture Mapping
Users willl know about what is Texture Mappnig, and can rotate of cube that Texture mapped.

## 3.Experience
Users can rotate cube, change colors, transport cube, can control size of cube.
Users will understand how cube translation works.

## Summery
I Thought in  WehGL pipeline, primitive assembly is impoirtant.
and Texture mapping can show how pipeline works
I hope this Website for helping people to undestand WebGL.
